# Mini RunRun – GitOps Application Deployment

## project Overview

Mini RunRun is a simplified end-to-end DevSecOps project designed to demonstrate how modern software deployments can be automated using **containerization, GitOps, CI/CD pipelines, and Kubernetes orchestration**.
The application consists of a lightweight **frontend** and **backend API**, packaged into containers and deployed through a fully automated GitOps workflow.

---

## Challenge

Traditional deployment workflows often involve manual steps, inconsistent environments, and poor traceability.
Teams face issues like:

* Repeated configuration drift
* Manual fixes after deployments
* Unreliable rollbacks
* No continuous validation of configurations
* Slow turnaround on changes

The goal was to implement a **consistent, automated, self-healing GitOps workflow** that ensures deployments are reproducible and version-controlled.

---

## Solution

Mini RunRun implements a standardized GitOps model using:

* **Docker** for containerizing services
* **Helm** for packaging Kubernetes deployments
* **ArgoCD** for GitOps-based delivery
* **GitHub Actions** for CI validation
* **Kubernetes (K3s)** for environment orchestration
* **Prometheus + Grafana** for monitoring

All infrastructure and application changes flow through Git, ensuring traceability and safe rollouts.
